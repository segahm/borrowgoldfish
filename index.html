    </div>
    <div id="description">
  <p>
Already today on <a href="http://borrowgoldfish.com/">BorrowGoldfish</a> you can find a valuation estimate of how much any restaurant is worth within several counties in Texas, Florida, and New Mexico. My hope is to build a prediction engine to quantify every small business in the United States. I figure, if Yelp managed to find consumers, real people, to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset" target="_blank">quantify</a> service quality at Small Businesses, I can definitely find data to quantify the financials at these same Small Businesses.
  </p>

        <p>"Small businesses employ the majority of U.S. workforce", "small business is the answer to taking the country out of recession" - these and other <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccabagley/2012/05/15/small-businesses-big-impact" target="_blank">similar</a> statements we are all used to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/economy/business/small-business" target="_blank">hearing</a>. With that being said, there has traditionally been little done by the mainstreet financial sector to bring attention to the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/loan-groan-spite-improving-economy-nyc-small-businesses-bank-loans-article-1.1788874" target="_blank">financing of small businesses</a>.  
</p>

        
        <p>
Yet, what makes today different from, say, 10 years ago is that there is all kinds of data available on SME. In addition to traditional economic and census data, there are now venues of data with which it is possible to predict business success and revenues by each business' exposure to web audience and local foot traffic. 
    </p>
        

        
        <p>This and other thoughts about small business arena have been with me for a long time. Already when I held a job at the World Bank, I was surprised that small businesses weren’t getting lending capital despite having Returns on Capital of over 28%. During my subsequent start-up, I have also encountered business lenders that commonly evaluated revenue potential of online shops using premise assessment. Even then I knew I could get at <a href="http://www.quora.com/Financial-Modeling/Where-can-web-startups-learn-about-financial-modeling-that-accounts-for-the-important-metrics-and-costs" target="_blank">a better revenue estimate</a> by looking at a company’s web pricing, ad spending, and conversion rates.
</p><p>This project is in its early stages, but it is my bet that I can do a much better job at quantifying achievements of small businesses, and hopefully help small businesses as a result. For now I'm focused only on restaurants since the competitive nature of the industry makes it easy to arrive at uniform cost calculations for each category and type of dinning place. I've decided to summarize all the calculations in one number: "how much the company is worth." This is surely not an ideal representation since the number is comprised of fundamentals and does not take into account the effect of <a target="_blank" href="http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/02/facebook-buys-whatsapp-for-19-billion.html" title="facebook buys whatsapp for 19 billion by Aswath Damodaran">The Trader (Pricing) View</a>. But it seems like it is still many times better than the next best approach out there.</p><p>So I just went ahead and built it.</p>

            The valuation of small businesses has been estimated and built by 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/nesovok">Segah Meer</a> based on 3rd party
 social, census, and economic analysis data. It is only an estimate. No 
data provider should be held responsible. The following are some of the
